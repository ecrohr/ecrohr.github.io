<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>
If you are interested in more about me or my research, please do not hesitate to contact me. The best way is via email: <a href="mailto:rohr@mpia.de" target="_blank">rohr@mpia.de</a>. Additionally, you can reach me via my office phone at +49 6221 528347, or you can come visit me in person! At the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, at Koenigstuhl 17 / 69117 Heidelberg, Germany, I'm usually located in office E-115, but can often be found wandering between coffee corners or by the ping pong table.

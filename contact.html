<h1>Contact</h1>

<p>
If you are interested in more about me or my research, please do not hesitate to contact me. The best way is via email: <a href="mailto:erohr@mpa-garching.mpg.de" target="_blank">erohr@mpa-garching.mpg.de</a>. Additionally you can come visit me in person! At the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, at Karl-Schwarzschild 1 / 85748 Garching bei M{\"u"}nchen, Germany, I'm located in office 182 but can often be found wandering between coffee corners.
